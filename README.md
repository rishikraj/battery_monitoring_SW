# battery_monitoring_SW
This repository includes:  Two C++ classes for controlling stacks of addressed LTC6804-2 chips or DC9143C demonstration boards connected on a multidrop isoSPI bus. These include functionality to write configuration registers, read battery cell voltages and status registers, and control General-Purpose Input-Output pins on each chip (e.g. to interface thermistors). Several Arduino sketches that demonstrate the functionality of the LTC6804 and DC9143C classes. An Arduino sketch that controls a Manzanita Micro PFC charger based on cell voltage readings from DC9143C demonstration boards.
